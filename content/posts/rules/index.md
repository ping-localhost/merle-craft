# Farms & AFk-ing

- AFK Farms / Redstone Farms are allowed.
- Be aware our server runs on Paper, so it will alter the Redstone mechanics (e.g prevents duping/lag).
- If your farm lags the server we will disconnect it (or you if you're AFK) and notify you.
- Chunk loaders are not allowed. If you are going to AFK farm then you must be logged in and AFK at the location of your farm.
