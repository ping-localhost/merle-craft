## Required roles

As of right now, you must have one of the following Discord roles to join the server:
- Admin
- Mods
- Twitch Mods
- Twitch Subscriber (any tier)

## Java Edition

- The IP for Merle's Minecraft server is `play.merlecraft.ga` (or you can use `15.235.17.245`).
- Start Minecraft, click `Multiplayer` and click `Add Server`. There should be two boxes, `Server Name` and `IP Address`. 
- The server name does not matter a bit. Call it what you like. 
- Now  fill in the box for IP and confirm your entries by clicking done.
- You will be taken back to the server list. The server should appear on it with green bars on the right.
- Click the server and then click `Join Server`.
- Have fun!

## Bedrock Edition

- The IP for Merle's Minecraft server is `play.merlecraft.ga` (or you can use `15.235.17.245`) and the port is `25565`.
- Start Minecraft, click `Play` and then `Servers`. Scroll down and click `Add Server`. There should be three boxes, `Server Name` and `Server IP` and `Port`.
- The server name does not matter a bit. Call it what you like.
- Now fill in the box for IP and the port one after. Confirm your entries by clicking play.
- Have fun!

### Consoles

If you are on a console, [following the instructions here](https://wiki.geysermc.org/geyser/using-geyser-with-consoles/) and use `play.merlecraft.ga` (or `15.235.17.245`) with port `25565`.

### Differences

[The differences between Java and Bedrock explained](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/differencesbetweenbedrockandjava). To put it simply, if you are using anything other than PC, you are using Bedrock. If you are on PC and using `Minecraft for Windows` it's Bedrock, otherwise, you are using the Java edition.

## DiscordSRV

We use DiscordSRV to link Minecraft accounts with Discord, as we only allow certain roles to join. When you connect to the server for the first time, you'll see a message like this: 
> ![Example of the connection screen](images/verification.png)

The next step is to contact our Discord bot that handles verification: 
> ![DM screen of the bot](images/dm.png)

Just message it the code you received before, in this case `3519` and your account will be linked, and you'll be able to play if you have the required Discord roles.
> ![Successfully linked!](images/linked.png)

**Note**: If you are unable to message the bot, make sure that you allow direct messages from server members, otherwise you cannot send it a message. ðŸ˜…
