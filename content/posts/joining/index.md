## Minecraft: Bedrock Edition

_Minecraft: Bedrock Edition_ refers to the multi-platform versions of Minecraft developed by Mojang Studios, Xbox Game Studios, and SkyBox Labs and based on the Bedrock codebase. [The differences between Java and Bedrock explained](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/differencesbetweenbedrockandjava).

### Android, iOS, iPadOS and Minecraft for Windows

- The IP for Merle's Minecraft server is `play.merlecraft.ga` (or you can use `51.178.105.151`) and the port is `25565`.
- Start Minecraft, click `Play` and then `Servers`. Scroll down and click `Add Server`. There should be three boxes, `Server Name` and `Server IP` and `Port`.
- The server name does not matter a bit. Call it what you like.
- Now fill in the box for IP and the port one after. Confirm your entries by clicking play.
- Have fun!

### Switch, PS4 and Xbox

If you are on these specific consoles, Microsoft does not allow you to add a server to the server list. You'll have to find a [solution that works for you here](https://wiki.geysermc.org/geyser/using-geyser-with-consoles/) and use the details above to connect. 

The easiest solution is probably [emulating a LAN game on your network](https://wiki.geysermc.org/geyser/using-geyser-with-consoles/#alternative-methods) via [your PC](https://github.com/jhead/phantom), [iOS device](https://apps.apple.com/app/bedrocktogether/id1534593376) or [Android device](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.extollite.bedrocktogetherapp) ([alternative](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smokiem.mcserverconnector)). 

## DiscordSRV

We use DiscordSRV to link Minecraft accounts with Discord, as we only allow certain roles to join. When you connect to the server for the first time, you'll see a message like this: 
> ![Example of the connection screen](images/verification.png)

The next step is to contact our Discord bot that handles verification: 
> ![DM screen of the bot](images/dm.png)

Just message it the code you received before, in this case `3519` and your account will be linked, and you'll be able to play if you have the required Discord roles.
> ![Successfully linked!](images/linked.png)

**Note**: If you are unable to message the bot, make sure that you allow direct messages from server members, otherwise you cannot send it a message. ðŸ˜…
