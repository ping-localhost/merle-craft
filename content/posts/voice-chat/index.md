As we are using [DiscordSRV](https://docs.discordsrv.com/), it is possible to use Discord for proximity voice chat.

If you want to participate in the voice chat, all you need to do is join the `#lobby` in the `Minecraft`-category:

After joining the lobby, you'll be automatically muted/suppressed by the bot, until you are near another player. When that happens , the bot will create a new voice channel and move all nearby players together and allow you to speak.
